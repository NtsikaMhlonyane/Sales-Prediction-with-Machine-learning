# Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

Sales Prediction with Machine Learning is a comprehensive project designed to assist businesses in accurately forecasting sales based on various advertising expenditures. In today's competitive business environment, understanding the impact of advertising strategies on sales performance is crucial for effective decision-making and resource allocation.

## Objectives:
- **Data-driven Decision Making:** Utilize historical advertising expenditure data to derive actionable insights into consumer behavior and sales trends.
- **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Identify high-impact advertising channels and target audience segments to optimize marketing budgets.
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Develop and deploy machine learning models capable of accurately forecasting sales, facilitating effective sales planning and revenue projection.

## Features:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and preprocess historical data on advertising expenditures to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize relationships between advertising channels and sales figures to uncover patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineer relevant features to enhance model performance and capture nuanced relationships within the data.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Implement regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization:** Assess model performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Fine-tune models to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Deployment and Integration:** Deploy trained models for real-time sales forecasting and integration with existing business processes.

## Target Audience:
- **Business Stakeholders:** Provide data-driven insights for strategic planning, resource allocation, and revenue optimization.
- **Data Scientists and Analysts:** Explore advanced machine learning techniques and contribute to model development and optimization.
- **Marketing and Sales Teams:** Refine advertising strategies, optimize target audience segmentation, and enhance campaign performance.
